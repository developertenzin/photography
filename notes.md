## Intro

Photography is all about balancing the three key elements: aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.

## Drop Auto - Understand Exposure

Exposure is how much of the light that is hitting your subject is entering your camera into the sensor.

###### Three things that control exposure:
1. Aperture (a.k.a F stop or IRIS)
  * Aperture is the space or the hole through which light passes into the sensor. It is also known as the F stop. The bigger the hole, the more light passes through and makes your images brighter and vice versa. F stop of an optical system is the ratio of the len's focal length to the diameter of the entrance pupil.
  * One interesting thing is that the larger the F stop number goes, the smaller the aperture becomes. And the bigger the Aperture, the small the f stop. hmm... :D
